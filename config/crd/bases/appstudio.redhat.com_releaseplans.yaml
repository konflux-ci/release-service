                                      MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                      spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                      incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector

                                      for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                      MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                      Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will

                                      MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                      between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                      The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                      or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                      In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                      - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                      violate MaxSkew(1).
                                      - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                      to topologies that satisfy it.
                                      It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                      MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                      When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                      Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                      And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                      this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                      As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                      scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                      If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                      Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                      When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.

                                      We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                      to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                      MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                                      to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                      "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                      Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                      exists or not.
                                      Defaults to "".

                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                      between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                      The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                      or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                      In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                      - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                      violate MaxSkew(1).
                                      - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                      to topologies that satisfy it.
                                      It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                      MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                      When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                      Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                      And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                      this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                      As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                      scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                      If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                      Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                      When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.

                                      TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key

                                      We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                      of pods into each bucket.
                                      We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                      Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                      nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                      e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                                      the spread constraint.
                                      - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                      - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                        but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                        skew.
                                      A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                      if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                      "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                      If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                      to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                      MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                      won't make it *more* imbalanced.
