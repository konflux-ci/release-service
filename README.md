# HACBS Release service

Release service is a Kubernetes operator to control the life cycle of HACBS-managed releases in the context of AppStudio.

## Running, building and testing the operator

This operator provides a [Makefile](Makefile) to run all the usual development tasks. This file can be used by cloning
the repository and running `make` over any of the provided targets.

### Running the operator locally

When testing locally (eg. a CRC cluster), the command `make run install` can be used to deploy and run the operator. 
If any change has been done in the code, `make manifests generate` should be executed before to generate the new resources
and build the operator.

### Build and push a new image

To build the operator and push a new image to the registry, the following commands can be used: 

```shell
$ make docker-build
$ make docker-push
```

These commands will use the default image and tag. To modify them, new values for `TAG` and `IMG` environment variables
can be passed. For example, to override the tag:

```shell
$ TAG=my-tag make docker-build
$ TAG=my-tag make docker-push
```

Or, in the case the image should be pushed to a different repository:

```shell
$ IMG=quay.io/user/release:my-tag make docker-build
$ IMG=quay.io/user/release:my-tag make docker-push
```

### Running tests

To test the code, simply run `make test`. This command will fetch all the required dependencies and test the code. The
test coverage will be reported at the end, once all the tests have been executed.

## Disabling Webhooks for local development

Webhooks require self-signed certificates to validate the resources. To disable webhooks during local development and
testing, export the `ENABLE_WEBHOOKS` variable setting its value to `false` or prepend it while running the operator
using the following command:

```shell
$ ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false make run install
```

## Metrics

Apart from the [metrics provided by controller-runtime](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/metrics-reference.html)
by default, this operator exports the following custom metrics:

| Metric name                                      | Type      | Description                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| release_concurrent_total                         | Gauge     | Total number of concurrent release attempts.                        |
| release_concurrent_deployments_total             | Gauge     | Total number of concurrent release deployment attempts.             |
| release_concurrent_post_actions_executions_total | Gauge     | Total number of concurrent release post actions executions attempts |
| release_concurrent_processings_total             | Gauge     | Total number of concurrent release processing attempts.             |
| release_deployment_duration_seconds              | Histogram | How long in seconds a Release deployment takes to complete.         |
| release_duration_seconds                         | Histogram | How long in seconds a Release takes to complete.                    |
| release_post_actions_execution_duration_seconds  | Histogram | How long in seconds Release post-actions take to complete.          |
| release_processing_duration_seconds              | Histogram | How long in seconds a Release processing takes to complete.         |
| release_pre_processing_duration_seconds          | Histogram | How long in seconds a Release takes to start processing             |
| release_validation_duration_seconds              | Histogram | How long in seconds a Release takes to validate                     |
| release_total                                    | Counter   | Total number of releases reconciled by the operator.                |
